# Synthesizing Continuous Audio with CGAN

## Motivation
In our life, it is very useful to play natural sounds like bird songs, ocean wave, flowing river, etc. But most of present works are only able to repeat a audio clip again and again. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network to synthesizing audio continuously, based on [WaveGAN](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan). 

## Requirement
```
conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0
